# Custom Voice Assistant (CPU-Only)

A simple customizable **CPU-Only Voice Assistant** that allows you to integrate your own Tacotron 2 model for Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis.  
This assistant captures user input, processes commands, and generates voice responses using your custom voice model locally.

The project is designed to work entirely on CPU ‚Äî no GPU is required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup & Usage

This section includes both full setup instructions and usage guide.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone Repository

Clone your repository (or prepare your local project folder).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages

The project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

‚úÖ Make sure you are using Python 3.9+.(Tested environment: Python 3.10)

Since this project is CPU-only, no CUDA or GPU configuration is necessary.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Custom Tacotron 2 Model

- Train or download a pre-trained Tacotron 2 model (ensure it's compatible with your current TTS pipeline).
- Place your Tacotron 2 checkpoint file inside the `tts_model/` directory.

Example:

```bash
tts_model/custom_tacotron2_checkpoint.pth
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Update Tacotron 2 Model Path

- Open `tts_controller.py`.
- Locate the variable where the Tacotron 2 model path is specified.
- Modify the path to point to your custom model.

Example:

```python
tacotron_path = 'tts_model/custom_tacotron2_checkpoint.pth' #change the voice model path here
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Voice Assistant

Finally, start your assistant by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

The assistant will start taking voice/text commands and respond using your custom voice model.

## üîß Notes

- ‚úÖ Fully CPU compatible (but slower inference compared to GPU).
- ‚úÖ No CUDA or GPU drivers required.
- ‚úÖ Everything operates locally.
- ‚úÖ The model will try to understand your intent through your text, and find the most suitable intent for you.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tacotron 2 models can still consume significant CPU and RAM resources. (I did try to reduce usage... A LOT...)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This guide assumes you already have a trained Tacotron 2 model; trained model is not included.

## Current Development

- Still in progress, lacking in functionality.
- Will build a local speech to text(or even your only voice recognization lets see)
